When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? In order to collaborate with others or to keep a copy of your work safe on the cloud.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? for the same reasons you wouldn't want git to make commits automatically, it would lead to too many and superfluous commit pushes and pulls.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? Clones copy a repository from GitHub to a local directory. Branches are also local and are basically a new head off the master head. Forks are copies of another user's repository on GitHub, similar to a branch.
